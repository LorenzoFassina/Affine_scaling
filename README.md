# üß© Linear Optimization Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects focused on **linear and combinatorial optimization**, implemented in **Python**.  
Each project explores a classical optimization problem ‚Äî from formulation to implementation ‚Äî combining **mathematical modeling**, **algorithm design**, and **computational experiments**.

## üìò Overview

The repository includes the following projects:

- **Knapsack Problem** ‚Äì Finding the optimal selection of items to maximize value within a weight constraint.  
- **CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem)** ‚Äì Optimizing delivery routes for multiple vehicles with capacity limits.  
- **Magic Square Problem** ‚Äì A constraint-based optimization problem for constructing valid magic squares.  
- **TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem)** ‚Äì Determining the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once.  
- **Affine Scaling Algorithm (Final Project)** ‚Äì Implementation of an **interior-point method** for solving **linear programming problems**.

Each project is self-contained and includes:
- Python implementation  
- Comments and explanations of key steps
