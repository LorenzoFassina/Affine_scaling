# Affine_scaling

This repository contains an implementation of the Affine Scaling algorithm, a classic interior-point approach for linear optimization.
The algorithm iteratively improves a feasible solution by scaling the constraint space and moving toward the optimal point while remaining within the feasible region.
The project is implemented in Python and includes visualizations of the  process.
